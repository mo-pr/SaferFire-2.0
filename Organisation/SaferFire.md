## Initial Situation
---
At the moment, the documentation and transfer of information during operations is often very slow and it is not uncommon for important information to be lost. In addition, many fire departments still write incident reports by hand at the scene of the incident and type them into the appropriate system (e.g.: syBOS) after the incident. 

Due to the aspects mentioned, it would be quite helpful to have a suitable tool that firstly simplifies and secondly accelerates and shortens precisely these processes.<br/><br/>

## Project Objectives and System Concepts
---
- **Display of alarm data**
- **Navigation to the scene of the incident**
- **Protocolation of the incident**
- **Respiratory protection monitoring**
- **Push Notifications**
  - When an alarm goes off, you should get a notification on your smartphone. 
- **ADR plate informations**
- **Rescue sheets**
- **Licence plate query**
  - It should be possible to make a query to the existing state database with our app
- **Automated Statistics, Heatmaps**
  - The old statistic was only filled with demo data. In the new version we want to save the data from our app and make           statics from them. An example would be a    heatmap, where regions with the most operation mission get highlighted.

- **Appointment calendar and news display**
  - Possibility to view and enter dates and news of his fire brigade
- **Expanding from Upper Austria to Austria**
  - Currently we are only using the "Fire Department API" for Upper Austria. In the future it should be possible to have access to       all of the departments in Austria.<br/><br/>
